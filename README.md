**AI-Powered Code Generation from Markdown Blueprints**

Transform your software architecture into production code using an agentic AI approach. Write markdown blueprints, let Claude handle the implementation details with intelligent verification and self-correction.

## 🚀 The Agentic Approach

Unlike traditional code generators, blueprints.md uses an **agentic AI system** that:

1. **🧠 Understands Context** - Claude analyzes your entire project structure
2. **🔍 Verifies Correctness** - Multi-stage verification catches issues before you do
3. **🔧 Self-Corrects** - Automatically fixes import errors and missing dependencies
4. **📈 Learns & Adapts** - Improves generation quality over time
5. **⚡ Processes Concurrently** - Parallel blueprint processing for speed

## 🎯 Quick Example

```bash
# Write this blueprint 👇
📄 api/tasks.md
```
```markdown
# api.tasks

Task CRUD operations with authentication.

Dependencies: @./models/task, @./auth

Requirements:
- FastAPI router for task endpoints
- Authentication required for all operations
- Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Filter tasks by user
- Proper error handling and validation
- Async database operations

Features:
- Get all tasks for authenticated user
- Create new task with validation
- Update existing task (owner only)
- Delete task (owner only)
- Mark task as completed
- Filter tasks by status
```

```bash
# Run this command 🚀
uvx blueprints-md generate api/tasks.md

# Or if installed globally
pip install blueprints-md
blueprints generate api/tasks.md

# Get production-ready code with:
✅ Proper imports (auto-detected)
✅ Error handling
✅ Type hints
✅ Logging
✅ Database transactions
✅ Authentication checks
✅ 200+ lines of production FastAPI code
```

## 🏗️ How It Works - The Agentic Pipeline

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as Blueprints CLI
    participant P as Parser
    participant G as Generator
    participant V as Verifier
    participant C as Claude AI
    
    U->>B: blueprints generate-project
    B->>P: Parse all .md files
    P->>P: Build dependency graph
    P->>G: Process in parallel
    
    par For each blueprint
        G->>C: Generate code with context
        C->>G: Return implementation
        G->>V: Verify code
        V->>V: Check syntax
        V->>V: Validate imports
        V->>C: Verify requirements
        alt Verification fails
            V->>G: Request fixes
            G->>C: Fix issues
        end
    end
    
    G->>U: Output production code
```

## 🌟 Agentic Features

### 1. **Intelligent Import Resolution**
The system uses Claude to dynamically detect and fix import issues:
```python
# Claude detects: ValidationError imported from wrong module
# Auto-corrects: from pydantic import ValidationError ✅
# Not: from fastapi.exceptions import ValidationError ❌
```

### 2. **Concurrent Processing**
Blueprints are processed in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor:
```python
# Old: Sequential processing (slow)
for blueprint in blueprints:
    generate(blueprint)  # 5 files = 5x time

# New: Concurrent processing (fast!)
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    executor.map(generate, blueprints)  # 5 files = 1x time
```

### 3. **Self-Healing Code Generation**
When verification fails, the system automatically attempts fixes:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Generate Code] --> B{Verify}
    B -->|Pass| C[✅ Done]
    B -->|Fail| D[Analyze Error]
    D --> E[Generate Fix]
    E --> B
```

### 4. **Context-Aware Generation**
Each file is generated with full awareness of:
- Project structure
- Dependencies
- Existing code patterns
- Framework conventions

## 🎨 AI-First Possibilities

### **1. Natural Language Blueprints**
```markdown
# services.email
Send emails with templates and retry logic

EmailService:
  - Send welcome emails to new users
  - Handle bounces and retries
  - Use SendGrid in production, mock in tests
  - Log all email events
```

Claude understands intent and generates complete implementation with SendGrid integration, retry decorators, and proper error handling.

### **2. Architecture from Requirements**
```bash
# Describe what you want
echo "Build a REST API for a todo app with user auth, 
      PostgreSQL storage, and Redis caching" > requirements.txt

# Generate entire architecture
blueprints generate-from-requirements requirements.txt

# Get complete project structure with:
📂 generated/
├── 📄 main.py          # FastAPI app
├── 📂 models/          # SQLAlchemy models
├── 📂 api/             # REST endpoints
├── 📂 services/        # Business logic
├── 📂 cache/           # Redis integration
└── 📄 docker-compose.yml
```

### **3. Cross-Language Generation**
```bash
# Python blueprint (using uvx for one-off execution)
uvx blueprints-md generate api/users.md --language python

# Same blueprint → TypeScript
uvx blueprints-md generate api/users.md --language typescript

# Same blueprint → Go
uvx blueprints-md generate api/users.md --language go
```

### **4. Design Pattern Implementation**
```markdown
# patterns.repository

Repository pattern for data access layer.

Dependencies: @./models/user, @./models/task, @./core/database

Requirements:
- Implement repository pattern for data access
- Separate business logic from data persistence
- Support dependency injection
- Include unit of work pattern
- Async operations with SQLAlchemy

User Repository:
- Standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Find user by email address
- Find all active users
- Soft delete support
- Pagination for user lists

Task Repository:
- Standard CRUD operations
- Find tasks by user ID
- Find overdue tasks
- Filter by status and priority
- Bulk operations support
```

Claude recognizes patterns and generates complete implementations with interfaces, dependency injection, and unit of work.

### **5. Framework-Aware Generation**
```markdown
# services.payment

Payment processing service with Stripe integration.

Dependencies: @./models/order, @./models/user

Requirements:
- Stripe payment processing
- Webhook handling for payment events
- Refund processing
- Payment method storage (PCI compliant)
- Subscription management
- Invoice generation

Security:
- PCI compliance measures
- Webhook signature verification
- Idempotency key support
```

Claude understands payment processing requirements and generates secure, production-ready Stripe integration with proper error handling and webhook management.

## 🧠 Advanced Agentic Features

### **Blueprint Evolution**
The system can suggest improvements to your blueprints:
```bash
blueprints analyze my-blueprint.md

# Suggestions:
💡 Add error handling for external API calls
💡 Implement caching for expensive operations
💡 Add rate limiting to public endpoints
💡 Consider adding pagination for list endpoints
```

### **Code Review & Refactoring**
```bash
# Review existing code and generate improved blueprint
blueprints reverse-engineer src/legacy_code.py

# Refactor using better patterns
blueprints refactor src/legacy_code.py --pattern repository

# Get:
📄 legacy_code.md (cleaned blueprint)
📄 legacy_code_refactored.py (improved implementation)
```

### **Incremental Updates**
```bash
# Modify blueprint
echo "add_payment_method(user_id: int, method: PaymentMethod)" >> api/users.md

# Regenerate only affected code
blueprints update api/users.md

# Smart updates:
✅ Preserves custom code sections
✅ Updates imports automatically
✅ Maintains existing functionality
```
