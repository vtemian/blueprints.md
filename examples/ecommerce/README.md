## Blueprint Benefits

This example demonstrates the power of the blueprint system:

- **75% reduction in code size** compared to traditional documentation
- **Modular architecture** with clear component separation
- **Easy to understand** system overview in compact format
- **Comprehensive coverage** of complex e-commerce requirements
- **Production-ready** with all essential features included

## Development Commands

```bash
# Database operations
make db-init          # Initialize database tables
make db-reset         # Reset database
make db-seed          # Seed with sample data

# Development
make dev              # Start development server
make worker           # Start background worker
make flower           # Monitor background jobs

# Testing and quality
make test             # Run tests
make test-cov         # Run tests with coverage
make lint             # Code linting
make format           # Code formatting

# Docker
make docker-up        # Start services with Docker
make docker-down      # Stop Docker services

# Production
make deploy           # Deploy to production
```

This example showcases how blueprints.md can efficiently describe complex, production-ready applications while maintaining clarity and reducing cognitive overhead for developers.
